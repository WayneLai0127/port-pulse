## Project Motivation

In the dynamic world of web development, it's not uncommon to find ourselves constantly spinning up local servers for testing and development. While this practice is essential for creating and refining our applications, it often comes with a common pitfall â€“ the inadvertent neglect of shutting down these local servers.

### The Battery Drainage Dilemma

For developers who work on-the-go or rely on laptops, the oversight of leaving local servers running can lead to an unexpected drain on precious battery life. Unintentionally consuming system resources and power, these lingering processes can have a significant impact on the overall efficiency and longevity of our devices.

### A Simple Solution for a Common Problem

Our project aims to address this common issue by providing a straightforward and user-friendly tool. By offering an intuitive interface to manage and monitor local servers, developers can ensure that resources are utilized judiciously, preventing unnecessary battery drainage.

### Key Features

- **Port Status Monitoring:** Easily check the status of specified ports.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Initiate and stop continuous monitoring of ports.
- **User-Defined Port:** Adjust the target port effortlessly.
- **Monitoring Interval Control:** Fine-tune the monitoring interval based on your preferences.

### Contribute to Efficiency

This project is not just a tool; it's a mindset. By adopting this application into your workflow, you contribute to a more efficient and sustainable development environment. Say goodbye to the unintentional drain on your laptop's battery, and hello to a more mindful and resource-conscious development practice.

**Join us on this journey to make web development not only powerful but also environmentally friendly!**

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Constantly checks the status of the specified port.
